Projects may address the diverse stack of collaborative protocols needed for successful multi-agent coordination such as: identity and attestation, on-chain delegation and roles, decentralized project management, fundraising and allocation, systems-aware strategic alignment processes, measurement and evaluation, and participatory governance and learning. These efforts may be theoretical and research-based or may be applied contexts of collaboration whose successful actualization could lead to protocolization of key activities and collaborative functions.  \n\nFor additional definitions and application details, please visit https://go.opencivics.co/wiki",

DeSci works off the idea that scientific knowledge should be accessible to everyone and that the process of scientific research should be transparent. DeSci is creating a more decentralized and distributed scientific research model, making it more resistant to censorship and control by central authorities. DeSci hopes to create an environment where new and unconventional ideas can flourish by decentralizing access to funding, scientific tools, and communication channels.Decentralized science allows for more diverse funding sources (from DAOs, quadratic donations(opens in a new tab) to crowdfunding and more), more accessible data and methods, and by providing incentives for reproducibility.",
